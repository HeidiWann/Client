# Client

Before starting the program and testing, you need to download the JavaFX file we sent with the rest of the files and unzip it to somewhere you can remember. After that, you download the code and open it with IntelliJ. Once the project is opened, go to File -> Project Strcuture -> Libraries -> lib. Once your in the lib, press the "+" -> Java. Then you should locate the JavaFX file and press on the lib file that is in the javaFX folder. After doing this, the project should work as intended. We aploigize for the inconvenience and if you encounter any problems, feel free to reach out to us on discord.

Main starts the program and and the architecture is according to MVC. When starting Client a JavaFXwindow should appear. The project tries to connect to the Server but the server does not yet have any big working functionalities, so there is no need to start the server. The project will print error messages when the connection to the server does not succeed, but it does not affect the code in any way.

This project is connected with the Server project https://github.com/HeidiWann/Server.git
