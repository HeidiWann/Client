# Client

Before starting the program and testing, you need to download the JavaFX file we sent with the rest of the files and
unzip it to somewhere you can remember. After that, you download the code and open it with IntelliJ. Once the project
is opened, go to File -> Project Strcuture -> Libraries -> lib. Once your in the lib, press the "+" -> Java. Then you
should locate the JavaFX file and press on the lib file that is in the javaFX folder. After doing this, the 
project should work as intended. We aploigize for the inconvenience and if you encounter any problems, feel free
to reach out to us on discord.

Main starts the program and and the architecture is according to MVC.
When starting Client a JavaFXwindow should appear. The project does not connect to the server.


This project is connected with the Server project https://github.com/HeidiWann/Server.git
